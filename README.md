## About me

Currently I am a student at Arteveldehogeschool, Ghent. Making websites is my passion! Motivated to learn new things. Counting planes at home because Steenokkerzeel is where I live!
Before going to college I went to CVO Volt in Haasrode. There I learned backend developer. Because of this study, it got me motivated to continue learning and now I'm here.

Semi-hardcore gamer that likes to listen to Drum & Bass, Frenchcore and Metalcore.
